        	<p align="justify">Your elderly mum is living alone. For some reason, she felt light headed and fell down. Given the intense pain she was in, she could hardly move or stand up. The consequences is very dire as she lives alone.
             		Luckily, vital band detected the fall and triggered an alert to Caregiver Network so that nearby volunteers and real healthcare assistant nearby as well as you(the caregiver) are notified about your mum's condition. At the same time, the wearable will detect vital status (heart rate and temperature) of your mum and transmit them so that the volunteers/healthcare assistant that is rushing to her will get real time critical information about your mum so that they can prepare assistance on the way to your mum. 
             		Once the healthcare assistant reached, he identified himself as loudly as he can.
             		Another elderly is saved for the day due to timely response and assistance!</p>
